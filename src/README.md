# Why I have an API key in a public repository
### Because it's free to get your own, and in case anyone abuses it, I can always reset it.

## How do I get my own?
### Don't want to risk someone breaking your bot? Go to https://console.developers.google.com/, enable the YouTube Data API v3, go to Credentials, Create Credentials, API key, Server key. Choose whatever name you want, then click Create. It's really not that hard, and totally free. You don't even have to worry about the quota because the default quota is 50 million units or so.
